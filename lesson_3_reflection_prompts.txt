When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are at somebody else's computer. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Not everything might be needed in wd. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork work only on Github, is to clone a repository and use it as you want. 
Clone works both in Github and local. 
Branch works on a specific repository on your local. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

"
    If I am about to go without Internet access for a while, for example to work
    on a plane, I can update my local copy before I leave.  I can do this even
    if I'm not ready to merge those changes into my own branches yet.  Then if I
    want, I can perform the merge while offline, or I need to know what the
    remote version is at some point, I have an easy way to access it.
